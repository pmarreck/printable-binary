Project Goal:
The user, Peter, has developed an Elixir library called PrintableBinary. The primary goal of this library is to serialize arbitrary binary data into a human-readable and copy-pastable UTF-8 string format, and then deserialize it back to the original binary data. This is intended as an alternative to hexadecimal encoding, offering better visual density and immediate recognizability of embedded printable ASCII text.

Key Design Goals for PrintableBinary:

    Visually Distinct Glyphs: Each of the 256 possible byte values should map to a unique, visually distinct character.
    ASCII Passthrough: Standard printable ASCII characters (byte values 32-126) should largely remain themselves for immediate recognition, with special handling for space, double quotes, and backslashes to make them more visible or avoid escaping.
    Single Character Width: Each encoded representation, even if multi-byte in UTF-8, should ideally render as a single character wide in a monospace terminal.
    Compactness (UTF-8 Byte Length): For control characters (0-31), DEL (127), and extended bytes (128-255), the UTF-8 representation should preferably be 2 bytes, with 3 bytes being acceptable. 4-byte characters (like many emojis) are to be avoided.
    Usability: The encoded string should be easily copyable, pastable, and printable.
    Efficiency: The encoding should be less memory-consuming than hexadecimal and visually more useful.
    Application: Useful for debugging, testing, and potentially as a general binary representation in code (to be decoded before use).

Original Elixir Implementation & Character Choice Review:

    The user provided Elixir code for PrintableBinary which defines specific UTF-8 characters for control codes (0-31), special handling for space (32), double quote (34), backslash (92), DEL (127), and a systematic mapping for bytes 128-255 into 2-byte UTF-8 sequences. Some specific overrides (e.g., for bytes 152, 184) were made for enhanced visual distinction.
    We reviewed these character choices. The assessment was generally positive, with the choices aligning well with the design goals.
    A key point of discussion was the encoding for byte 26 (SUB/Ctrl-Z). The original Elixir code used "Ƶ️" (U+01B5 followed by U+FE0F Variation Selector 16), resulting in a 5-byte UTF-8 sequence. It was recommended and agreed to simplify this to just "Ƶ" (U+01B5), a 2-byte sequence, for the Lua port to better adhere to byte-length goals and simplify decoding.

Porting to Lua 5.1:

    The user requested a port of this PrintableBinary logic to Lua 5.1.
    Challenges: Lua 5.1 treats strings as sequences of bytes with no built-in UTF-8 awareness. This means all UTF-8 byte sequences for the chosen characters must be handled explicitly.
    Lua Implementation Details:
        A Lua module PrintableBinary was outlined.
        encode_map: A Lua table mapping original byte values (0-255) to their corresponding UTF-8 string representations (e.g., encode_map[0] = "\226\136\133" for "∅").
        decode_map: A reverse table mapping the UTF-8 string representations back to the original byte values (e.g., decode_map["\226\136\133"] = 0).
        encode(binary_string): Iterates through input bytes, looks up each byte's representation in encode_map, and concatenates them.
        decode(printable_string): Iterates through the encoded string, attempting to match the longest possible byte sequence (3 bytes, then 2, then 1) against keys in decode_map to reconstruct the original byte. This "longest match first" strategy is crucial for correct decoding of variable-length UTF-8 character representations.
    Addressing Ambiguity Concerns: The user raised a concern about whether a sequence of 1-byte encoded characters could be misidentified as a 2-byte or 3-byte encoded character. We established that this is not an issue with the current scheme due to:
        The fundamental difference in byte values: 1-byte (ASCII) encodings are < 0x80, while the first byte of all chosen multi-byte UTF-8 encodings is > 0xC1.
        The "longest match first" decoding strategy correctly prioritizes multi-byte sequences if they were possible, but the distinct leading bytes prevent misinterpretation of concatenated ASCII as a valid multi-byte sequence from the map.

Current Status:

    The design goals and character choices (with the byte 26 refinement) are established.
    A detailed Lua 5.1 implementation structure and code for the PrintableBinary module, including encoding and decoding logic and map construction, has been provided and discussed.
    The robustness of the decoding approach against potential ambiguities (given the chosen character set) has been affirmed.

The next AI can use this summary to understand the project's context, design decisions, and the Lua 5.1 implementation details if further refinement or feature additions are requested.
Okay, here's a summary of our discussion about your "PrintableBinary" project for the next AI:

Project Goal:
The primary goal is to create a system (initially in Elixir, then ported to Lua 5.1) for encoding arbitrary binary data into a human-readable and copy-pastable UTF-8 string format. A corresponding decode function is also required to revert the string back to the original binary data. This is intended for easier inspection and visualization of binary streams in UTF-8 capable terminals, offering an alternative to hexadecimal dumps.

Key Design Priorities for the Encoding:
The user (Peter Marreck) laid out the following design goals for the character choices in the encoding:

    Visually Distinct: Each byte's representation should be unique.
    ASCII Passthrough: Standard printable ASCII characters (byte values 32-126, with a few exceptions) should be represented as themselves for immediate recognition of embedded text.
    Single Character Width: Each encoded representation, even if multi-byte in UTF-8, should ideally render as a single visual character to maintain the length correspondence with the original byte stream.
    Byte Length of Glyphs: For control characters (0-31), non-printable characters, and byte values 128-255, the UTF-8 representation should ideally be 2 bytes long, with 3 bytes being acceptable if necessary. 4-byte characters (like many emojis) are to be avoided.
    Usability: Encoded strings should be easily copyable, pastable, and printable.
    Efficiency: The encoding should be less memory-consuming and more visually immediate than hexadecimal.
    Utility: Useful for debugging/testing and potentially as a general binary representation in code (to be decoded before use).
    No Emoji: Avoided due to 4-byte requirement and being visually jarring.

Elixir Implementation (PrintableBinary module):

    The user provided Elixir code that defines encode/1 and decode/1 functions.
    encode/1 uses specific UTF-8 characters (mostly 2 or 3 bytes long) for control codes (0-31) and byte 127 (DEL).
    Printable ASCII characters are largely passed through, with special representations for space (␣), double quote (˵), and backslash (Ʌ).
    Bytes 128-255 are mapped to 2-byte UTF-8 sequences using clever arithmetic to generate characters primarily from Latin-1 Supplement and Latin Extended-A blocks.
    Specific overrides exist for bytes 152 (Ō) and 184 (ŏ) for enhanced visual distinction from the null character's representation (∅).

Assessment of Elixir Character Choices:

    The choices were generally found to be very good and well-aligned with the design goals.
    A key suggestion was made regarding byte 26 (Ctrl-Z/SUB). The Elixir code used Ƶ️ (LATIN CAPITAL LETTER Z WITH STROKE followed by VARIATION SELECTOR-16), which resulted in a 5-byte UTF-8 sequence. It was recommended to use just Ƶ (2 bytes) to better meet the design goals and simplify handling. The user agreed with this suggestion.

Porting to Lua 5.1:

    The user requested a port of the Elixir module's logic to Lua 5.1.
    Challenges for Lua 5.1: Lua 5.1 treats strings as raw byte sequences and lacks built-in UTF-8 awareness (unlike later versions like 5.3+ which have a utf8 library). This means all UTF-8 character byte sequences must be handled explicitly.
    Lua Implementation Details:
        A Lua module PrintableBinary was outlined and then provided.
        It uses two main tables: encode_map (mapping original byte value 0-255 to its chosen UTF-8 string representation) and decode_map (mapping the UTF-8 string representation back to the original byte value). These maps are populated when the module is loaded.
        The encode function iterates through the input binary string byte by byte, looks up the corresponding UTF-8 string from encode_map, and concatenates the results.
        The decode function iterates through the printable UTF-8 string. It uses a "longest match first" strategy (trying to match 3-byte sequences, then 2-byte, then 1-byte from the decode_map) to correctly parse the variable-length UTF-8 character representations.
        The Lua string escape sequences (\ddd for decimal byte values) were used to define the UTF-8 character byte sequences.
        The port adopted the suggestion to use the 2-byte Ƶ for byte 26.

Discussion of Potential Decoding Ambiguity:

    The user raised a concern about whether a sequence of two 1-byte encoded characters (ASCII) could accidentally form the byte sequence of a 2-byte or 3-byte encoded character, leading to misinterpretation by the "longest match first" decoder.
    It was concluded that this ambiguity is not an issue with the current scheme because:
        1-byte encoded characters are ASCII (bytes 0x00-0x7F).

        2-byte and 3-byte encoded characters are multi-byte UTF-8 sequences whose first byte is always 0xC2-0xF4.
        Therefore, a sequence of ASCII bytes cannot be byte-identical to one of the chosen multi-byte UTF-8 characters because their leading bytes are in different, non-overlapping ranges.
        The "longest match first" decoder will correctly identify and process single ASCII characters individually.

Current Status:
The user has received a functional Lua 5.1 port of their PrintableBinary concept, incorporating feedback on character choices and addressing concerns about decoding robustness. The next step is for the user to take this Lua code for further editing/integration elsewhere.
